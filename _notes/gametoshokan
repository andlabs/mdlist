スーパーファミコン サテラビュー BS-X 〜それは名前を盗まれた街の物語〜　 より当時録画したビデオテープからデジタル化したものです。 ノイズがあったりトラッキングがあっていないところがあります...

...this is gonna take a while to go through
(look for those with メガドライブ　セガ・ゲーム図書館 in the title)
And ugh, there's only a small peek at the gameplay per-se
(for Kinetic Connection)
...I'd rather take the two Nei volumes

メガドライブ セガ・ゲーム図書館 対決！こらむす

:O !
The missing Columns
...
Why does the copyright say 1992
...
WHY DOES IT HAVE COLUMNS 3 MUSIC
SikLast Thursday at 3:15 PM
OK it really feels like it's proto Columns 3 o.O
I wonder if there are leftovers in the Columns 3 ROM...
SikLast Thursday at 3:28 PM
...there's a Phantasy Star II novel
(or something like that)

(starts at 2:38)
ACT 1 is missing :/
Argh
Also skipped 3-2 >:((edited)
Oh, people roleplaying over mail then all that got collected up for SNN
andlabsLast Thursday at 3:33 PM
okay do me a favor: if there's a list, just link it; if not, send me an email (andlabs@lostsig.net) with the list that you compile
SikLast Thursday at 3:33 PM
I don't think there's a list, I'm still going through these videos
I'll probably make a playlist myself if they don't
andlabsLast Thursday at 3:34 PM
all right in that case just keep linking them here and I'll archive this conversation in particular
SikLast Thursday at 3:34 PM
WELL NEVERMIND https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDJ4e492luVwqTTpABgwzYcugiaMLTuJv

メガドライブ　セガ・ゲーム図書館 - YouTube

That sure makes it convenient
Making local copies of all videos anyway just in case (don't trust me for archival tho :v)
OH HEY THAT LAST ONE I LINKED HAS A DATE (march 17, and since this is from just before it was shut down, my guess is 1992?)(edited)
What

(予価 means "expected price" btw)
andlabsLast Thursday at 3:44 PM
actual price:
3,800円
SikLast Thursday at 3:46 PM
...why was it so cheap
andlabsLast Thursday at 3:46 PM
because it was a very cheap game
in general
SikLast Thursday at 3:46 PM
Reminds me, there's debate in Japan about moving to group digits by four instead of three
(to match how the language works)
andlabsLast Thursday at 3:47 PM
https://segaretro.org/images/4/49/Artalive_md_jp_cover.jpg

they considered it an educational title, not a game
and I don't think the mouse was included
SikLast Thursday at 3:48 PM
wonders how large is the ROM
andlabsLast Thursday at 3:48 PM
(yes I know the genre means ETC)
SikLast Thursday at 3:48 PM
Ugh, we'll need to discuss later when you have more time, some weird shit is popping up here
(Sega Formula Club? I look up but find nothing about that...)
andlabsLast Thursday at 3:49 PM
just dump it all in now :stuck_out_tongue: I'll be putting this whole thing in atext file that will be going into github.com/andlabs/mdlist under the _notes folder
I don't have the ROM on me, but sega's list says it's
SikLast Thursday at 3:49 PM
Just bookmark the playlist
